It is an application built on HTML5 and Javascript and uses the local storage of your browser. For communication, it features a single big input bar on the top of the page. Unfortunately it can not communicate through sound as of now.\r\n\r\n### He accounts for your time\r\nIf you type \"Meeting: With John's Team\", he is dumb enough to take out what is before the first colon(:) and start accounting for the time you spent doing that (in this case, 'Meeting'). If you don't have any colon in your text, he stops the timer.\r\n\r\n### He follows you, with your sleep cycles!\r\nWhen you type 'Sleeping' into the input bar, he asks for a confirmation and increases your sleep cycle count by 1. You can view the statistics for any amount of sleep counts.\r\n\r\n### Apps in JhonnyM\r\nThere are two kind of apps, native and third-party. All these apps are located on the left side of the page.\r\n\r\n### JhonnyM is good with your friends and your family.\r\nThe app has support for multiple users.
