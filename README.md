JhonnyM
=======
A productivity app for monitoring your daily progress.

The is a client-side application and uses the Web SQL introduced with HTML5.

Features:

1. Single input area for everything.
2. Web SQL database used for efficient processing.
3. Multiple User Support.
4. New categories automatically generated based on input.

For the CSS design it uses the Twitter Bootstrap v3 Framework and Animate.css.

This app can be made much better by using APIs instead of embedding frames.

Working example of the project can be found on http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~arkanath/JhonnyM/.
